# Requests for Catalog Store Cursors in Data Lake Relational Engine 

When you request a cursor type from your client application, a cursor is provided. Cursors are defined, not by the type as specified in the programming interface, but by the sensitivity of the result set to changes in the underlying data.

Depending on the cursor type you ask for, a cursor is provided with behavior to match the type.

Cursor sensitivity is set in response to the client cursor type request.
