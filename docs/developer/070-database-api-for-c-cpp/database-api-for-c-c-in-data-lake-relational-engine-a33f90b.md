# Database API for C/C++ in Data Lake Relational Engine 

The data lake Relational Engine C application programming interface \(API\) is a data access API for the C / C++ languages. The C API specification defines a set of functions, variables and conventions that provide a consistent database interface independent of the actual database being used. Using the data lake Relational Engine C API, your C / C++ applications have direct access to data lake Relational Engine database servers.
