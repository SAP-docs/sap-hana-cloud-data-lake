# Installing the SQLAlchemy Dialect \(sqlalchemy-sqlany\)

SQLAlchemy is a Python-based toolkit and object relational mapper. The sqlalchemy-sqlany dialect allows users to create SQLAlchemy applications that communicate with a SQL Anywhere database server.

The most current software and documentation for the SQL Anywhere SQLAlchemy dialect is available from the PyPI \(Python Package Index\) web site \([https://pypi.python.org/pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi)\). Search for `sqlalchemy-sqlany`.

The dialect is also available from [https://github.com/sqlanywhere/sqlalchemy-sqlany](https://github.com/sqlanywhere/sqlalchemy-sqlany). The SQLAlchemy driver requires the SQL Anywhere Python driver, which is included in the SQL Anywhere install, but it is also available from [https://github.com/sqlanywhere/sqlanydb](https://github.com/sqlanywhere/sqlanydb).
