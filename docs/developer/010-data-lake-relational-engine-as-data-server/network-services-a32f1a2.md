# Network Services

Open Client network services include Net-Library, which provides support for specific network protocols such as TCP/IP and DECnet. The Net-Library interface is invisible to application developers. However, on some platforms, an application may need a different Net-Library driver for different system network configurations. Depending on your host platform, the Net-Library driver is specified either by the system's configuration or when you compile and link your programs.
