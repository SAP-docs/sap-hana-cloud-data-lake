# DB-Library and Client Library

Open Client provides two core programming interfaces for writing client applications: DB-Library and Client-Library.

Open Client DB-Library provides support for older Open Client applications, and is a completely separate programming interface from Client-Library. DB-Library is documented in the *Open Client DB-Library/C Reference Manual*, provided with the Open Client product.

Client-Library programs also depend on CS-Library, which provides routines that are used in both Client-Library and Server-Library applications. Client-Library applications can also use routines from Bulk-Library to help high-speed data transfer.

Both CS-Library and Bulk-Library are included in the Open Client, which is available separately.
