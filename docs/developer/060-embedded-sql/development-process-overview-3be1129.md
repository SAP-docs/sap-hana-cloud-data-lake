# Development Process Overview

Once the program has been successfully preprocessed and compiled, it can be linked with an **import library** for DBLIB to form an executable file. When the database server is running, this executable file uses DBLIB to interact with the database server.

The database server does not have to be running when the program is preprocessed.
