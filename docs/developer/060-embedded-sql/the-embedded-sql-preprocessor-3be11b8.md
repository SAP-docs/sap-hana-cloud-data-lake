# The Embedded SQL Preprocessor

The Embedded SQL preprocessor is an executable named `sqlpp`.



The preprocessor command line is as follows:

```
sqlpp [ <options> ] <sql-filename> [ <output-filename> ]
```

The preprocessor translates the Embedded SQL statements in a C or C++ source file into C code and places the result in an output file. A C or C++ compiler is then used to process the output file. The normal extension for source programs with Embedded SQL is `.sqc`. The default output file name is the *<sql-filename\>* with an extension of `.c`. If the *<sql-filename\>* has a `.c` extension, then the default output file name extension will change to `.cc`.

> ### Note:  
> When an application is rebuilt to use a new major version of the database interface library, the Embedded SQL files must be preprocessed with the same version's Embedded SQL preprocessor.

The following table describes the preprocessor options.

Description



</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

 *\-d* 



</td>
<td valign="top">

Generate code that reduces data space size. Data structures are reused and initialized at execution time before use. This increases code size.



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

 *\-e* *<level\>* 



</td>
<td valign="top">

Flag as an error any static Embedded SQL that is not part of a specified standard. The *<level\>* value indicates the standard to use. For example, `sqlpp -e c03 ...` flags any syntax that is not part of the core ANSI/ISO SQL Standard. The supported *<level\>* values are:

 c08
 :   Flag syntax that is not core SQL/2008 syntax

  p08
 :   Flag syntax that is not full SQL/2008 syntax

  c03
 :   Flag syntax that is not core SQL/2003 syntax

  p03
 :   Flag syntax that is not full SQL/2003 syntax

  c99
 :   Flag syntax that is not core SQL/1999 syntax

  p99
 :   Flag syntax that is not full SQL/1999 syntax

  e92
 :   Flag syntax that is not entry-level SQL/1992 syntax

  i92
 :   Flag syntax that is not intermediate-level SQL/1992 syntax

  f92
 :   Flag syntax that is not full-SQL/1992 syntax

  t
 :   Flag non-standard host variable types

 For compatibility with previous software versions, you can also specify e, i, and f, which correspond to e92, i92, and f92, respectively.

<tr>
<td valign="top">

 *\-h* *<width\>* 



</td>
<td valign="top">

Limit the maximum length of lines output by sqlpp to *<width\>*. The continuation character is a backslash \(\\\) and the minimum value of *<width\>* is 10.



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

 *\-k* 



</td>
<td valign="top">

Notify the preprocessor that the program to be compiled includes a user declaration of SQLCODE. The definition must be of type long, but does not need to be in a declaration section.



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

 *\-m* *<mode\>* 



</td>
<td valign="top">

Specify the cursor updatability mode if it is not specified explicitly in the Embedded SQL application. The *<mode\>* can be one of:

 HISTORICAL
 :   In previous versions, Embedded SQL cursors defaulted to either FOR UPDATE or READ ONLY \(depending on the query and the ansi\_update\_constraints option value\). Explicit cursor updatability was specified on DECLARE CURSOR. Use this option to preserve this behavior.

  READONLY
 :   Embedded SQL cursors default to READ ONLY. Explicit cursor updatability is specified on PREPARE. This is the default behavior. READ ONLY cursors can result in improved performance.

 

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

 *\-n* 



</td>
<td valign="top">

Generate line number information in the C file. This consists of *<\#line\>* directives in the appropriate places in the generated C code. If the compiler that you are using supports the *<\#line\>* directive, this option makes the compiler report errors on line numbers in the SQC file \(the one with the Embedded SQL\) as opposed to reporting errors on line numbers in the C file generated by the Embedded SQL preprocessor. Also, the *<\#line\>* directives are used indirectly by the source level debugger so that you can debug while viewing the SQC source file.



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

 *\-o* *<operating-system\>* 



</td>
<td valign="top">

Specify the target operating system. The supported operating systems are:

 UNIX
 :   Use this option if you are creating a 32-bit Linux application.

  UNIX64
 :   Use this option if you are creating a 64-bit Linux application.

Quiet mode. Do not print messages.

Generate non-reentrant code.



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

 *\-s* *<len\>* 



</td>
<td valign="top">

Set the maximum size string that the preprocessor puts into the C file. Strings longer than this value are initialized using a list of characters \('*<a\>*', '*<b\>*', '*<c\>*', and so on\). Most C compilers have a limit on the size of string literal they can handle. This option is used to set that upper limit. The default value is 500.

 *\-w* *<level\>* 



</td>
<td valign="top">

Flag as a warning any static Embedded SQL that is not part of a specified standard. The *<level\>* value indicates the standard to use. For example, `sqlpp -w c08 ...` flags any SQL syntax that is not part of the core SQL/2008 syntax. The supported *<level\>* values are:

 c08
 :   Flag syntax that is not core SQL/2008 syntax

  p08

 *\-z* *<cs\>* 



</td>
<td valign="top">

Specify the collation sequence. For a list of recommended collation sequences, run <code>iqinit -l</code> at a command prompt.

The collation sequence is used to help the preprocessor understand the characters used in the source code of the program, for example, in identifying alphabetic characters suitable for use in identifiers. If -z is not specified, the preprocessor attempts to determine a reasonable collation to use based on the operating system and the IQLANG and IQCHARSET environment variables.
