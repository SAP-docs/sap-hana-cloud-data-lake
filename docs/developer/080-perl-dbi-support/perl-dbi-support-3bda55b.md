# Perl DBI Support

DBD::SQLAnywhere is a database driver for the Perl Database Independent Interface \(DBI\), which is a data access API for the Perl language.

The Perl DBI API specification defines a set of functions, variables and conventions that provide a consistent database interface independent of the actual database being used. Using Perl DBI and DBD::SQLAnywhere, your Perl scripts have direct access to data lake Relational Engine database servers.
