# ODBC CLI

ODBC \(Open Database Connectivity\) is a standard call level interface \(CLI\) developed by Microsoft Corporation. It is based on the SQL Access Group CLI specification. ODBC applications can run against any data source that provides an ODBC driver. ODBC is a good choice for a programming interface if you want your application to be portable to other data sources that have ODBC drivers.
