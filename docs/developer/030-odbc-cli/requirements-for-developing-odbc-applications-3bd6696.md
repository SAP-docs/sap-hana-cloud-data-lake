# Requirements for Developing ODBC Applications

You can develop applications using a variety of development tools and programming languages, and access the database server using the ODBC API.

To write ODBC applications for the database server, you need:

-   A C/C++ compiler capable of creating programs for your environment.

-   The Microsoft ODBC Software Development Kit. This is available on the Microsoft Developer Network, and provides documentation and additional tools for testing ODBC applications.


> ### Note:  
> Some application development tools, which already have ODBC support, provide their own programming interface that hides the ODBC interface. This documentation does not describe how to use those tools.



## The ODBC Driver Manager

Microsoft Windows includes an ODBC driver manager. For Linux a driver manager is included with the database server software.
