# ODBC Example

A simple ODBC program that connects to the sample database and immediately disconnects can be found in <code><i>%IQDIRSAMP17%</i>\SQLAnywhere\ODBCConnect\odbcconnect.cpp</code>.



This example shows the steps required in setting up the environment to make a connection to a database server, as well as the steps required in disconnecting from the server and freeing up resources.
