# UpdateCommand Property

Specifies an SACommand that is executed against the database when the Update method is called to update rows in the database that correspond to updated rows in the DataSet.



Visual Basic
:   ```
Public Shadows Property UpdateCommand As SACommand
```

C\#
:   ```
public new SACommand UpdateCommand {get;set;}
```



## Remarks

During Update, if this property is not set and primary key information is present in the SelectCommand, then the UpdateCommand can be generated automatically if you set the SelectCommand property and use the SACommandBuilder. Then, any additional commands that you do not set are generated by the SACommandBuilder. This generation logic requires key column information to be present in the SelectCommand.

When UpdateCommand is assigned to a previously created SACommand, the SACommand is not cloned. The UpdateCommand maintains a reference to the previously created SACommand object.

If execution of this command returns rows, then these rows can be merged with the DataSet depending on how you set the UpdatedRowSource property of the SACommand object.
