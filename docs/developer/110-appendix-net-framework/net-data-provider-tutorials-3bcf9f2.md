# .NET Data Provider Tutorials

The Simple and Table Viewer sample projects introduce you to .NET application programming using the .NET provider. A tutorial is included that takes you though the steps of building the Simple Viewer .NET database application using Microsoft Visual Studio.

These sample projects can be used with Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 or later versions. If you use Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 or later versions, you may have to run the Microsoft Visual Studio *Upgrade Wizard*.
