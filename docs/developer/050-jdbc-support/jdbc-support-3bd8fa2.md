# JDBC Support

JDBC is a call-level interface for Java applications. JDBC provides you with a uniform interface to a wide range of relational databases, and provides a common base on which higher level tools and interfaces can be built.

The software includes the data lake Relational Engine JDBC driver, which is a Type 2 driver.
