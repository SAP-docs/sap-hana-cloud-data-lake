# JDBC Applications

You can develop Java applications that use the JDBC API to connect to a database.

Java classes using JDBC provide a more powerful alternative to SQL stored procedures for incorporating programming logic into the database.

JDBC provides a SQL interface for Java applications: to access relational data from Java, you do so using JDBC calls.

The phrase client application applies both to applications running on a user's computer and to logic running on a middle-tier application server.

You can use JDBC in the following ways:

 JDBC on the client
 :   Java client applications can make JDBC calls to a database server. The connection takes place through a JDBC driver.
