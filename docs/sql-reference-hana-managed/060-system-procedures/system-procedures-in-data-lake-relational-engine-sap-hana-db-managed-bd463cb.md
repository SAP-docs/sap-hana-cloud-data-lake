# System Procedures in Data Lake Relational Engine \(SAP HANA DB-Managed\)

Use the system-supplied procedures to retrieve system information or execute tasks that change data.



System procedures, both user-defined and system supplied, can be run within a REMOTE\_EXECUTE procedure or when directly connected to data lake Relational Engine.

For examples running system procedures using REMOTE\_EXECUTE, see [REMOTE\_EXECUTE\_QUERY Guidance and Examples for Running Stored Procedures](remote-execute-query-guidance-and-examples-for-running-stored-procedures-3e7f86d.md).
