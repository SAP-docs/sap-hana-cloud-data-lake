## Syntax Elements


<dl>
<dt><b>

*<grantee\>*

</b></dt>
<dd>

Specifies the user or role that the privilege is being granted to. A role is a named collection of privileges and can be granted to either a user or another role.

```
<grantee> :: = { <user_name> | <role_name> }
```

```
<user_name> ::= <unicode_name>
```

```
<role_name> ::= [ <hana_relational_container_schema_name>].<identifier>
```

If a privilege or role is granted to a role, then all users granted that role have the specified privilege or role.

If you want to allow several database users to perform the same actions, then create a role, grant the required privileges to this role, and finally grant the role to the different database users.

When granting roles to roles, a tree of roles can be built. When granting a role \(R\) to a role or user \(G\), user G has all the privileges directly granted to role R and all privileges granted to roles that have been granted to role R.

*<user\_name\>* specifies the grantee's user name.

*<role\_name\>* specifies the grantee's role name with optional schema name.

A reference to a schema-local role \(that is, a role for which a schema\_name was specified at creation time\), must always be preceded by its *<hana\_relational\_container\_schema\_name\>* wherever it is referenced \(for example, <code>GRANT <b><i class="varname">&lt;hana_relational_container_schema_name&gt;</i></b>.<i class="varname">&lt;role_name&gt;</i> TO...)</code>.



</dd><dt><b>

*<system\_privilege\>*

</b></dt>
<dd>

Grants the specified system privilege.

Users with the USERGROUP OPERATOR privilege can also create and drop users, but only within the usergroup they have the USERGROUP OPERATOR privilege on \(CREATE USER *<user\_name\>* SET USERGROUP *<usergroup\_name\>*\).

A user can have the USERGROUP OPERATOR privilege on more than one usergroup, and a usergroup can have more than one user with the USERGROUP OPERATOR privilege on it.

When granting USERGROUP OPERATOR, you must include the keyword USERGROUP before the name of the usergroup \(for example: <code>GRANT USERGROUP OPERATOR ON <b>USERGROUP</b> <i class="varname">&lt;usergroup_name&gt;</i> TO <i class="varname">&lt;grantee&gt;</i></code>\). This is slightly different syntax than granting other object privileges.

Components of the SAP HANA database can create new object privileges. These privileges use the component-name as first identifier of the system privilege and the component-privilege-name as the second identifier.

## Description

This syntax is specific to granting SAP HANA database privileges in a data lake Relational Engine context. For a full listing of available privileges, see the *GRANTING Statement \(Access Control\)* in the *SAP HANA Cloud, SAP HANA Database SQL Reference Guide*.

## Permissions

To use the GRANT statement to grant privileges to other users and roles, a user must have the privilege and also the permissions required to grant that privilege.

**DBADMIN \(cloud super-user\), non-RESTRICTED users, and RESTRICTED users**: A DBADMIN user has all system privileges and the role PUBLIC. However, a DBADMIN user canâ€™t select or change data in another user's tables unless this privilege has been explicitly granted. A non-RESTRICTED user has the PUBLIC role, has the privileges required to create objects in their own default schema, and can grant privileges on their objects to other users and roles. A RESTRICTED user doesnâ€™t have the PUBLIC role and canâ€™t create objects in their own schemas. RESTRICTED users have only the privileges that have been explicitly granted to them. For more information on SAP HANA database users, see *Managing SAP HANA Database Users* in the *SAP HANA Cloud, SAP HANA Database Administration Guide*.

Users canâ€™t grant privileges to themselves.

For objects that are dependent on other objects, like views being dependent on tables, there could be times when the schema of the dependent object doesnâ€™t have a complete set of privileges. This situation can occur if the user doesnâ€™t have privileges on the underlying objects on which their object depends.

## Examples

Grant the INSERT and DELETE privileges for the table V\_T1 in schema SYSHDL\_CONTAINER1 to USER1.

```
GRANT INSERT, DELETE ON SYSHDL_CONTAINER1.V_T1 TO USER1;
```

Grant the role ROLE1 to USER1.

```
GRANT ROLE1 TO USER1 WITH ADMIN OPTION;
```

Grant the EXECUTE privilege for the REMOTE\_EXECUTE procedure for container SYSHDL\_CONTAINER1 to USER1 with the ability to further grant the privilege to other users or roles.

```
GRANT EXECUTE ON SYSHDL_CONTAINER1.REMOTE_EXECUTE TO USER1 WITH GRANT OPTION;
```

Grant the SELECT privilege on the SAP HANA database schema SYSHDL\_CONTAINER1 to USER1.

```
GRANT SELECT ON SCHEMA SYSHDL_CONTAINER1 TO USER1;
```

Grant the CATALOG READ privilege to USER1 with the ability to further grant the privilege to other users or roles.

```
GRANT CATALOG READ TO USER1 WITH ADMIN OPTION;
```

Grant the REMOTE EXECUTE privilege on the remote source SYSHDL\_CONTAINER1\_SOURCE to USER1.

```
GRANT REMOTE EXECUTE ON REMOTE SOURCE SYSHDL_CONTAINER1_SOURCE TO USER1;
```
