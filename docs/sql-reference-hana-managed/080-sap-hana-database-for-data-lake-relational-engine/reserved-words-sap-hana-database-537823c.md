# Reserved Words \[SAP HANA Database\]

Reserved words have a special meaning to the SQL parser and canâ€™t be used when defining an identifier.

The following list provides you with the current reserved words for the SAP HANA database. You can obtain this list by querying the RESERVED\_KEYWORDS system view:

```
SELECT * FROM RESERVED_KEYWORDS ORDER BY RESERVED_KEYWORD;
```

In addition to the following SAP HANA database reserved keywords, avoid using the reserved keywords from the most recent ANSI SQL standard to ensure the compatibility of your SQL statements. However, if you do use these reserved words, we recommend placing them in uppercase and delimiting them with double quotation marks to ensure compatibility.
