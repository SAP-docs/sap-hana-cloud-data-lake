# SQL Statements in Data Lake Relational Engine \(SAP HANA DB-Managed\)

Execute data lake Relational Engine SQL statements.

Some data lake Relational Engine SQL statement can only be executed within the REMOTE\_EXECUTE procedure. A few can be run either within the REMOTE\_EXECUTE procedure or when directly connected to data lake Relational Engine. Check the **Restriction** section at the beginning of each SQL statement for guidance.

For examples running SQL statements using the REMOTE\_EXECUTE procedure, see [REMOTE\_EXECUTE Usage Examples for Executing SQL Statements](remote-execute-usage-examples-for-executing-sql-statements-fd99ac0.md).
