## Remarks

If a role that is being revoked was not granted to *<grantee\>*, then the statement does nothing, and does not return an error.

REVOKE ROLE fails with an error if, as a consequence of executing the statement, the number of administrators for the role being revoked would fall below the required minimum as set by the min\_role\_admins database option.

When revoking a role from the MANAGE ROLES system privilege, you must use the special internal representation SYS\_MANAGE\_ROLES\_ROLE. For example, REVOKE ROLE *<user-defined role name\>* FROM SYS\_MANAGE\_ROLES\_ROLE.
