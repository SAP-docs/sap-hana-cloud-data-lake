# CREATE \(Virtual\) EXISTING TABLE Statement for Data Lake Relational Engine \(SAP HANA DB-Managed\) \[SQL on Files\]

Create a new virtual table that represents an existing table on a SQL on Files external catalog.

> ### Restriction:  
> This topic is limited to SQL on Files use cases.
> 
> This data lake Relational Engine \(SAP HANA DB-Managed\) SQL on Files SQL statement can be used as follows:
> 
> -   When connected to SAP HANA database as a SAP HANA database user.
> 
> -   Using the REMOTE\_EXECUTE procedure. See [REMOTE\_EXECUTE Usage Examples for Executing SQL Statements](../030-sql-statements/remote-execute-usage-examples-for-executing-sql-statements-fd99ac0.md).



## Syntax

```
CREATE EXISTING TABLE [ <owner> .]<virtual-table-name>
   [ ( <column-definition-list> ) ]
   AT '<location-string>'

<column-definition-list> ::=
   <column-name> <data-type>[,<column-name> <data-type>,...]

<location-string> ::=
   <remote-server-name>..<remote-schema-name>.<remote-table-name>
```



## Parameters

 *<virtual-table-name\>*
 :   The name of the IQ virtual table. The defintion of the virtual table is stored in the IQ catalog.

    > ### Note:  
    > Tables used as virtual tables cannot have names longer than 30 characters.

  *<column-definition-list\>*
 :   If you do not specify column definitions, data lake Relational Engine derives the column list from the metadata it obtains from the remote table. If you do specify column definitions, data lake Relational Engine verifies them. When data lake Relational Engine checks column names, data types, and lengths:

    -   Column names must match identically \(although case is ignored\).
    -   Data types in `CREATE EXISTING TABLE` must match or be convertible to the data types of the column of the remote table. You may encounter some errors if you select from a table in which the data types do not match or other inconsistencies exist.
    -   Each columnâ€™s length is checked. If the lengths of `CHAR`, `VARCHAR`, `BINARY`, `DECIMAL`, and `NUMERIC` columns do not match, a warning message is issued, but the command is not aborted. You might choose to include only a subset of the actual remote column list in your `CREATE EXISTING` statement.

  AT '*<location-string\>*'
 :   Specifies the location of the remote object. Use a period to delimit the location strings.

    The `AT` clause includes a location string that consists of the following parts:

    -   The name of the remote server
    -   The remote schema
    -   The remote table name

 

## Remarks

The `CREATE EXISTING TABLE` statement creates a new, local, virtual table that maps to a table in data lake Relational Engine. The `EXISTING` keyword is used with `CREATE TABLE` and `IN FILES_SERVICE` to specify that a table already exists remotely in SQL on Files, and to import its metadata to the new virtual table. This syntax establishes the remote table as a visible entity to users. The software verifies that the table exists on the SQL on Files remote server before it creates the table.

IQ virtual tables defined on SQL on Files`CREATE INDEX`, remote tables are always read only. No DDLs,`INSERT`, `DELETE`, or `UPDATE` statements can be performed on this type of virtual table.

If the remote table does not exist, the statement is rejected with an error message.

## Privileges

You have the EXECUTE permission on the REMOTE\_EXECUTE procedure of the SAP HANA database relational container schema associated with the data lake Relational Engine relational container \(SYSHDL\_*<relational\_container\_name\>*\).



## Examples

The following example creates a virtual table named `nation` for the nation table at the remote server `SQLonFilesServer1`:

```
CREATE EXISTING TABLE nation
                            ( n_nationkey int,
                              n_name char(25),
                              n_regionkey int,
                              n_comment char(152)) 
	AT 'SQLonFilesServer1..ExternalSchema1.nation'
```

The following example creates a virtual table named `sof_employee` for the Employees table at the remote server RemoteSOF:

```
CREATE EXISTING TABLE sof_employee
	AT 'RemoteSOF..ExternalSchema1.Employees'
```
