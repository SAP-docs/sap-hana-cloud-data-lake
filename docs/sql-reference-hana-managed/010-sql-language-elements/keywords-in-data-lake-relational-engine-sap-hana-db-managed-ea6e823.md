# Keywords in Data Lake Relational Engine \(SAP HANA DB-Managed\)

Each SQL statement contains one or more keywords.



SQL isn't case-sensitive to keywords.

The following statements are equivalent, where SELECT and FROM are keywords: Â 

```
SELECT *FROM Employees;

Select *From Employees;

select * from Employees;

sELECT * FRoM Employees;
```
