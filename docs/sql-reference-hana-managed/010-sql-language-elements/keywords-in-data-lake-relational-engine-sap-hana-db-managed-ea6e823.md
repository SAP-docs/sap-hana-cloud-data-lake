# Keywords in Data Lake Relational Engine \(SAP HANA DB-Managed\)

Each SQL statement contains one or more keywords.



Though SQL keywords aren't case-sensitive, all keywords in the documentation are shown in UPPERCASE.

The following statements are equivalent, where SELECT and FROM are keywords: Â 

```
SELECT * FROM Employees;

Select * From Employees;

select * from Employees;

sELECT * FRoM Employees;
```
