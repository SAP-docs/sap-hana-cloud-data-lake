## Privileges

Privilege Category: PUBLIC



### 

The privileges required depend on your data lake Relational Engine \(SAP HANA DB-Managed\) connection method and whether you are setting the option temporarily or permanently:


<dl>
<dt><b>

Connected to SAP HANA database as a SAP HANA database user:

</b></dt>
<dd>

-   To set a database option permanently, use REMOTE\_EXECUTE.

    Requires one of:

    -   You are a member of the container administrator role, \(SYSHDL\_*<relational\_container\_name\>*\_ROLE\), for the relational container.
    -   EXECUTE permission on the SAP HANA database REMOTE\_EXECUTE procedure associated with the data lake Relational Engine relational container \(SYSHDL\_*<relational\_container\_name\>*\).

    -   See [REMOTE\_EXECUTE Guidance and Examples for Setting Permanent Database Options](remote-execute-guidance-and-examples-for-setting-permanent-database-options-0023bea.md).


-   To set a database option temporarily, use the SET\_TEMPORARY\_OPTION procedure, which requires you be a member of the container administrator role, \(SYSHDL\_*<relational\_container\_name\>*\_ROLE\), for the relational container.

    -   See [SET\_TEMPORARY\_OPTION Procedure for SAP HANA Database](../080-sap-hana-database-for-data-lake-relational-engine/set-temporary-option-procedure-for-sap-hana-database-abcd703.md).





</dd><dt><b>

Connected directly to data lake Relational Engine as a data lake Relational Engine user:

## Remarks

When BLOCKING is off, a transaction receives an error when it attempts a write operation and is blocked by the read lock of another transaction.

When BLOCKING is on, any transaction attempting to obtain a lock that conflicts with an existing lock held by another transaction waits until every conflicting lock is released or until the BLOCKING\_TIMEOUT is reached. If the lock isn’t released within BLOCKING\_TIMEOUT milliseconds, then an error is returned for the waiting transaction.

> ### Note:  
> BLOCKING isn't supported on worker nodes of the multiplex cluster. SAP HANA servers can only access worker nodes.
