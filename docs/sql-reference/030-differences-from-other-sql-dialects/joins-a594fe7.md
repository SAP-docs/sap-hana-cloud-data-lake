# Joins

Data lake Relational Engine allows `automatic joins` between tables.

In addition to the `NATURAL` and `OUTER` join operators supported in other implementations, data lake Relational Engine allows `KEY` joins between tables based on foreign-key relationships. This reduces the complexity of the `WHERE` clause when performing joins.
