## Remarks

CREATE\_HG\_AND\_FORCE\_PHYSICAL\_DELETE determines whether delete operation physically removes rows from an HG immediately or defers the removal to a point later in the load:

-   Setting CREATE\_HG\_AND\_FORCE\_PHYSICAL\_DELETE to ON \(default\) instructs data lake Relational Engine to perform a physical delete, which increases the performance of some queries \(link in .. list and ordered projection, for example\), but can cause delete queries on tables with tiered HG indexes to run more slowly.

-   Setting CREATE\_HG\_AND\_FORCE\_PHYSICAL\_DELETE to OFF instructs data lake Relational Engine to perform a virtual or deferred delete, which improves delete query performance, but can impact queries on tables with tiered HG indexes.


Set CREATE\_HG\_AND\_FORCE\_PHYSICAL\_DELETE before creating a tiered HG column index. It does not affect preexisting HG indexes. It has no effect on sp\_iqrebuildindex. This option persists through the life of the tiered HG index, and cannot be changed or modified unless the index is dropped and the option toggled before re-creating the index \(sp\_iqrebuildindex cannot modify the status of the index\).

> ### Note:  
> sp\_iqrebuildindex output includes a Force Physical Delete column that identifies the status of this option.
