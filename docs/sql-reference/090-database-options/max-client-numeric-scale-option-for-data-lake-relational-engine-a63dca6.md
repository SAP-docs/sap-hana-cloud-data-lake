## Remarks

When data lake Relational Engine performs its calculation, it promotes data types to an appropriate scale and size that ensure accuracy. The promoted data type might be larger than the original defined data size. You can set this option to the scale you want for numeric results.

Multiplication, division, addition, subtraction, and aggregate functions can all have results that exceed the maximum precision and scale.

For example, when a DECIMAL\(88,2\) is multiplied with a DECIMAL\(59,2\), the result could require a DECIMAL\(147,4\). With MAX\_CLIENT\_NUMERIC\_PRECISION of 126, only 126 digits are kept in the result. If MAX\_CLIENT\_NUMERIC\_SCALE is 4, the results are returned as a DECIMAL\(126,4\). If MAX\_CLIENT\_NUMERIC\_SCALE is 2, the results are returned as a DECIMAL\(126,2\). In both cases, there is a possibility for overflow.
