## Remarks

When an application opens a cursor, data lake Relational Engine creates a FIFO \(first-in, first-out\) buffer to hold the data rows generated by the query. CURSOR\_WINDOW\_ROWS defines how many rows can be put in the buffer. If the cursor is opened in any mode other than NO SCROLL, data lake Relational Engine allows for backward scrolling for up to the total number of rows allowed in the buffer before it must restart the query. This is not true for NO SCROLL cursors, as they do not allow backward scrolling.
