## Remarks

Setting 1 \(fast accumulator\) is faster and uses less space for floats and doubles than setting 2. This setting uses a single double precision variable to add double and float numbers, and is subject to the known accuracy limitations of such an approach.

Setting 2 \(default\) \(medium accumulator\) uses multiple double precision variables to accumulate floats and doubles. It is very accurate for addends in the range of magnitudes 1e-20 to 1e20. While it loses some accuracy outside of this range, it is still accurate enough for most applications. Setting 2 allows the optimizer to choose hash for faster performance more easily than setting 3.

Setting 3 \(large accumulator\) is highly accurate for all floats and doubles, but its size often precludes the use of hash optimization, which will be a performance limitation for most applications.
