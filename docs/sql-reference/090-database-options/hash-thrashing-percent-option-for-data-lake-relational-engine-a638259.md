## Remarks

If a query that uses hash algorithms causes an excessive number of hard disk I/Os \(paging buffers from memory to disk\), query performance is negatively affected, and server performance might also be affected. HASH\_THRASHING\_PERCENT controls the percentage of hard disk I/Os allowed before the statement is rolled back, and you see one of the following error messages:

-   ***Hash insert thrashing detected.***
-   ***Hash find thrashing detected.***
