# MINIMIZE\_STORAGE Option for Data Lake Relational Engine

Minimizes use of storagespace for newly created columns in data lake Relational Engine databases.

## Usage

This data lake Relational Engine database option can be used when connected as follows:

-   Connected directly to data lake Relational Engine as a data lake Relational Engine user.

## Dependencies

MINIMIZE\_STORAGE applies to databases running with FP\_NBIT\_IQ15\_COMPATIBILITY is set to ON. If it is set to OFF, the database engine ignores this option.

## Remarks

If FP\_NBIT\_IQ15\_COMPATIBILITY is ON, MINIMIZE\_STORAGE optimizes storage for new columns by using as little as one byte of space per row wherever appropriate. By default, this option is OFF for the PUBLIC role, and the specialized storage optimization does not occur for all newly created columns; when MINIMIZE\_STORAGE is OFF for the PUBLIC role but ON as a temporary user option, one-byte storage is used for new columns created by that user ID.

In data lake Relational Engine databases, setting MINIMIZE\_STORAGE is ON is equivalent to placing an IQ UNIQUE 255 clause on every new column, with the exception of certain data types that are by nature too wide for one-byte storage. When MINIMIZE\_STORAGE is ON, there is no need to specify IQ UNIQUE, except for columns with more than 65536 unique values.

When the ratio of main memory to the number of columns is large, turning MINIMIZE\_STORAGE to ON is beneficial. Otherwise, storage of new columns generally benefits by turning this option OFF.

> ### Note:  
> Avoid running a database when FP\_NBIT\_IQ15\_COMPATIBILITY is set to ON. All data lake Relational Engine runtime behavior is available with the data lake Relational Engine interface.
