# SYSVIEW System View for Data Lake Relational Engine

Each row in the SYS.SYSVIEW system view describes a view in the database. SYS.SYSVIEW list both normal views and materialized views.



> ### Restriction:  
> This data lake Relational Engine system view can be used when connected as follows:
> 
> -   Connected directly to data lake Relational Engine as a data lake Relational Engine user.



The tables and columns that make up this view are provided in the following SQL statement.

```
ALTER VIEW "SYS"."SYSVIEWS"( vcreator,
  viewname,viewtext ) 
  AS SELECT u.user_name,t.table_name,v.view_def
    FROM SYS.SYSTAB as t
      JOIN SYS.ISYSVIEW AS v ON(t.object_id = v.view_object_id)
      JOIN SYS.ISYSUSER AS u ON(u.user_id = t.creator)
```

You can find additional information about views in the SYS.SYSSYSTAB system view.

You can also use the dbo.sa\_materialized\_view\_info system procedure for a readable format of the information for materialized views.
