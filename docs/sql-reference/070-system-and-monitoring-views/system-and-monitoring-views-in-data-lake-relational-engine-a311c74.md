# System and Monitoring Views in Data Lake Relational Engine

Data lake Relational Engine supports system views, consolidated views, compatibility views, and SAP Adaptive Server Enterprise Transact-SQL compatibility views to view the contents of system tables.

A number of predefined system views are provided that present the information in the system tables in a readable format.

The definitions for the system views are included with their descriptions. Some of these definitions are complicated, but you do not need to understand them to use the views.

Monitoring views provide system performance information. Use the monitoring views to diagnose and troubleshoot data lake Relational Engine configuration issues and server performance problems.
