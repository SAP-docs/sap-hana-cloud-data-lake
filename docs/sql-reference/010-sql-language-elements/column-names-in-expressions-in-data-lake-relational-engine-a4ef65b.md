# Column Names in Expressions in Data Lake Relational Engine

A column name is an identifier preceded by an optional correlation name. A correlation name is usually a table name.



If a column name has characters other than letters, digits, and underscores, then the name must be surrounded by quotation marks \(“”\). For example, the following are valid column names:

```
Employees.Surname
City
"StartDate"
```
