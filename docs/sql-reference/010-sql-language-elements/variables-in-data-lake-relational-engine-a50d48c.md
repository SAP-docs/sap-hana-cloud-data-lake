# Variables in Data Lake Relational Engine

Data lake Relational Engine supports local variables, connection-level variables, and global variables.

All global variables have names beginning with two @ signs. For example, the global variable *<@@version\>* has a value that is the current version number of the database server. Users cannot define global variables.
