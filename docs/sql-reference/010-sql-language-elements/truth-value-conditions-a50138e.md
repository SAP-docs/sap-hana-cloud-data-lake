# Truth Value Conditions

The truth value of a condition is either TRUE or FALSE.



The syntax for truth value conditions is:

```
IS [ NOT ] <truth-value>
```

Without the `NOT` keyword, the condition is TRUE if the *<condition\>* evaluates to the supplied *<truth-value\>*, which must be one of TRUE, FALSE, or UNKNOWN. Otherwise, the value is FALSE. The `NOT` keyword reverses the meaning of the condition but leaves UNKNOWN unchanged.
