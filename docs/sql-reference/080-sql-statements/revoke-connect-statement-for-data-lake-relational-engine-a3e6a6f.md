## Remarks

Use system procedures or CREATE USER and DROP USER statements, not `GRANT` and `REVOKE` statements, to add and remove user IDs.

You cannot revoke the connect privileges from a user if he or she owns database objects, such as tables. Attempting to do so with a `REVOKE` statement or `sp_iqdroplogin` stored procedure returns an error such as ***Cannot drop a user that owns tables in runtime system.***

> ### Note:
