# Objects Supporting Schemas



Object types that have an owner and are considered unique using *<owner-name\>*.*<object-name\>* can exist as part of a schema. For example, tables can be referenced as *<owner-name\>*.*<table-name\>*. Two users can each have a table named foo â€“ user1.foo and user2.foo. Therefore, a table can be part of a schema. On the other hand, although an event can be referenced as user1.foo, two users cannot have an event named foo, so events are not eligible to be part of a schema.
