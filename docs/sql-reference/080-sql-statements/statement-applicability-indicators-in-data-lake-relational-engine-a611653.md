# Statement Applicability Indicators in Data Lake Relational Engine

Some statement titles are followed by an indicator in square brackets that shows where the statement can be used.

These indicators are as follows:

-   \[ESQL\] – the statement is for use in Embedded SQL.
-   \[Interactive SQL\] – the statement is for use only in Interactive SQL \(`dbisql`\).
-   \[SP\] – the statement is for use in stored procedures or batches.
-   \[T-SQL\] – the statement is implemented for compatibility with SAP Adaptive Server Enterprise. In some cases, the statement cannot be used in stored procedures that are not Transact-SQL format. In other cases, there is an alternative statement that is closer to the ISO/ANSI SQL standard that is recommended unless Transact-SQL compatibility is an issue.

If two sets of brackets are used, the statement can be used in both environments. For example, \[ESQL\] \[SP\] means a statement can be used either in Embedded SQL or in stored procedures.
