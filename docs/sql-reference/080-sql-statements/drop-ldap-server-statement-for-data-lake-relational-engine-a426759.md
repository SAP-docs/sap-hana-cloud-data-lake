## Remarks

The `DROP LDAP SERVER` statement fails when it is issued against an LDAP server configuration object that is in a READY or ACTIVE state. This ensures that an LDAP server configuration object in active use cannot be accidentally dropped.The `DROP LDAP SERVER` statement also fails if a login policy exists with a reference to the LDAP server configuration object.

## Examples

In the following example, assuming that references to the LDAP server configuration object have been removed from all login policies, the following two sets of commands are equivalent:

```
DROP LDAP SERVER ldapserver1 WITH DROP ALL REFERENCES WITH SUSPEND;
```

```
ALTER LDAP SERVER ldapserver1 WITH SUSPEND DROP LDAP SERVER ldapserver1 WITH DROP ALL REFERENCES;
```

Using the WITH DROP ALL REFERENCES and WITH SUSPEND parameters eliminates the need to execute an `ALTER LDAP SERVER` statement before the `DROP LDAP SERVER` statement
