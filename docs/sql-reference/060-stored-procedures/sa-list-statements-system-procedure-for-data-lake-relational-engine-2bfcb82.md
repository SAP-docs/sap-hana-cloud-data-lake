## Remarks

The sa\_list\_statements system procedure can be used in a CALL statement or in the FROM clause of a SELECT statement. The statement executing the sa\_list\_statements system procedure is not included in the result.

The SQLStatement column is rewritten from the original text due to semantic transform optimizations and normalization in a manner similar to that of the REWRITE function. Sensitive information such as encryption keys and passwords is replaced with \*\*\*. Because of these changes, the SQLStatement value requires interpretation when comparing to statements in the application, which might have a different form.



## Privileges

None



## Side Effects

None



The following example returns the list of statements for the connection:

```
CALL sa_list_statements();
```

The following example returns the list of statements that contribute to the max\_statement\_count resource governor:

```
SELECT *
FROM sa_list_statements()
WHERE dropped_by_app=0;
```
