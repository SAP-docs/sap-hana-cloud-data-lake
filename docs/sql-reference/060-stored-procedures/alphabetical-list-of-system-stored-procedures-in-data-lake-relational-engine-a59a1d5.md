# Alphabetical List of System Stored Procedures in Data Lake Relational Engine

System stored procedures carry out System Administrator tasks in the IQ main store.

System stored procedures are owned by the user ID `dbo`.

> ### Note:  
> By default, the maximum length of column values displayed by Interactive SQL Classic is 30 characters. This might be inadequate for displaying output of stored procedures such as `sp_iqstatus`. To avoid truncated output, increase the length by selecting *Command* \> *Options* from the Interactive SQL menu, then select and enter a higher value for Limit Display Columns, Limit Output Columns, or both.
